How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    -It's allows me to easily and quickly show the difference that happen between two files, by only showing the lines that have changes.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    -If I changed any line by mistake, It's totally being helpful to undo my changable and return back to the original code again

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    -cons are that sometimes you may forget to commit, So it will be better to automaticly save changes. 
    -pros are that the ability to type what you have done in every commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    -In my opionion it used for saving time for programmer by saving multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    -I use git log to acutally view the entire history of the file and then git diff will compare two different versions to see what exactly changed in each version.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    -It helps me make changes without being worry, as if any break happen I will be able to go back to the old version so easy and fix it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    -I would like to use it during programming.
